# Privacy Policy  

Last Updated: 10/03/2025

## 1. Introduction  
Welcome to **Mistralis**. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data is (or isn’t) collected when you use the app.

## 2. Data Collection & Processing  
Mistralis **does not collect, store, or share any personal data**. The app functions solely as a **client for third-party AI chat services**, and all interactions occur directly between you and the AI provider.

### 2.1 Authentication & Accounts  
- Some AI models require user authentication (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini).  
- Mistralis **does not manage or store login credentials**—authentication is handled externally by the AI provider.  

### 2.2 AI Chat Data  
- Any messages you send and receive are processed by the respective AI model (e.g., OpenAI, Mistral, Google, etc.).  
- Mistralis **does not log, store, or access** your conversations.  

### 2.3 Third-Party Services  
Mistralis integrates with third-party AI models. Their respective privacy policies apply:  
- [Mistral AI Privacy Policy](https://mistral.ai/privacy-policy/)  
- [OpenAI (ChatGPT) Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/terms)  
- [Google Gemini Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)  
- [DeepSeek Privacy Policy](https://deepseek.com/privacy-policy)  
- [Grok (X AI) Privacy Policy](https://x.ai/privacy)  

## 3. Local Storage  
- Preferences such as AI model selection and UI settings are stored locally on your Mac.  
- **No chat data is stored on your device by Mistralis.**  

## 4. Security & Data Protection  
Since Mistralis does not process or store personal data, there are **no user data security risks** within the app itself. However, we recommend reviewing the security policies of the AI providers you use.

## 5. Changes to This Policy  
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any significant changes will be communicated via the project repository.
